# Code of Conduct

The Rbanism community aims to empower urbanism researchers, students, educators and practitioners to use open-source
software and related open-science practices effectively and with confidence. It raises awareness, stimulates engagement
and builds capacity by demonstrating the benefits of reproducibility, automation and scalability for urbanism research,
education and practice.

The purpose of this Code of Conduct (CoC) is to enable an environment in which diverse individuals can collaborate and
interact in mutual respect. We recognize a shared responsibility to create and maintain that environment for the benefit
of all. Some behaviors, therefore, are specifically prohibited:

- Discriminating, racist, intimidating, harassing, lewd, demeaning, bullying, stalking, or threatening speech or actions
- Any real or implied threat of physical harm
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption of speakers or events (verbally or physically)
- Retaliation against an individual for reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors
- Retaliation against an individual for participating in the investigation of a report of harassment or other
  unacceptable behaviors
- Advocating or encouraging any of the above behaviors
- Falsely reporting harassment or other unacceptable behaviors.

Critical examination of beliefs and viewpoints does not, by itself, constitute hostile conduct or harassment. Similarly,
use of sexual imagery or language in the context of a professional discussion might not constitute hostile conduct or
harassment if necessary to the topic of discussion.

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, or if you believe a harassment problem exists, please
report it as soon as possible to the enforcer of this Code of Conduct, Claudiu Forgaci, either in person or
electronically (with the option to remain anonymous). If the person you should report to is the target of the complaint,
you may contact the
[TU Delft External Confidential Advisor](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/about-tu-delft/strategy/integrity-policy/confidential-advisors/the-team).
The target of the complaint will not be involved in handling or resolving the incident. Every code of conduct violation
report will be treated with seriousness and care.

## Enforcement

Participants who are asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. Community Coordinator(
s) and event organizers retain the right to take appropriate actions, including: (i) mediation between complainant and
alleged perpetrator(s), to reach an amicable resolution; (ii) issue a verbal warning; (iii) expel the offender(s) from
the event (particularly if a participant's immediate safety is threatened); and/or, (iv) exp the offender(s) from the
Rbanism community. Community Coordinator(s) and event organizers will also discuss with the complainant whether they
wish to contact the confidential advisor(s) at the affiliated University. The alleged perpetrator(s) will be notified of
a complaint as soon as possible, and be given a chance to respond to the complaint.
